3. **`frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`**
   - Added UserProfile component to header

## 🎯 How It Works

### Authentication Flow

1. **User visits app** → Shows loading screen
2. **Check auth state** → Firebase checks if user is logged in
3. **Not logged in** → Show login page
4. **User clicks "Continue with Google"** → Google OAuth popup
5. **User signs in** → Firebase creates session
6. **Log to database** → User info saved to Firestore
7. **Show app** → User can access dashboard

### Database Logging

Every time a user signs in:
- ✅ User document created in Firestore (if new user)
- ✅ User info updated: email, name, photo
- ✅ Last login timestamp recorded
- ✅ First login timestamp saved (for new users)

### User Session

- ✅ Sessions persist across page refreshes
- ✅ Users stay logged in until they sign out
- ✅ Secure token-based authentication
- ✅ No passwords stored (Google handles auth)

## 🔧 Setup Required

### Before App Works:

1. **Create Firebase project** (5 minutes)
2. **Enable Google Authentication** (2 minutes)
3. **Enable Firestore Database** (2 minutes)
4. **Get Firebase credentials** (1 minute)
5. **Create `.env` file** with credentials (2 minutes)

Total setup time: ~15 minutes

See **`GOOGLE_AUTH_SETUP.md`** for detailed instructions.

## 📊 Database Structure

```
Firestore
└── users (collection)
    └── {userId} (auto-generated document ID)
        ├── uid: "abc123..."
        ├── email: "user@gmail.com"
        ├── displayName: "John Doe"
        ├── photoURL: "https://..."
        ├── createdAt: Timestamp
        └── lastLogin: Timestamp
```

## 🎨 UI Components

### Login Page
- Clean, modern design
- Google branding
- Error messages
- Loading states
- Responsive (mobile-friendly)

### User Profile (Header)
- User photo and name
- Dropdown menu
- Sign out button
- Click-outside to close

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ **Google OAuth**: No password management needed
- ✅ **Environment variables**: Keys stored securely

## 📱 Mobile Responsive

- ✅ Login page works on mobile
- ✅ User profile adapts to small screens
- ✅ Touch-friendly buttons

## 🚀 Production Ready

To deploy:
1. Set environment variables in hosting platform
2. Add production domain to Firebase authorized domains
3. Update Firestore security rules
4. Deploy!

## 📈 Analytics Possibilities

With user data in Firestore, you can track:
- Total number of users
- New signups per day
